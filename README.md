Mini-project 2.

It sets up an environment on codespaces and uses Github Actions to run a Makefile.
I have created a project which has functions dedicated to doing the following on a given dataset and returning the output:

* Calculating the mean,
* Calculating the median,
* Calculating the standard deviation,
* Visualizing data in the form of a scatterplot
